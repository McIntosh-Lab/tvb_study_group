# Session 2 - Imaging inputs and post-processing considerations for brain network modelling

Slide deck for this session can be found [here](.) and recording can be found [here](.).

## GOALS
Participants are able to make appropriate decisions about post-processing of structural connectomes 
- Create or check appropriateness of inputs
- Understand formatting requirements for inputs

### Concepts covered: 
- dMRI cleaning & tractography primer
  - Overview of dMRI processing resources, tutorials, and use cases (FSL, MRtrix, TVB-UKBB)
- Pitfalls for dMRI tractography (probabilistic vs deterministic)
- Graph theory fundamentals
- Post-processing choices (normalization within subject (streamlines vs probabilities), types of thresholding, normalization across the sample)
  - Handling NaN values (removing susceptible ROIs or subjects, interpolation, inference from existing literature)
- What makes a good connectome?
  - Weights & tract length distributions
  - Graph metrics (density, degree, centrality)
  - Qualitative features
- Functional features for optimization
  - MRI FC, FCD, FCDvariance
- Required TVB inputs for each simulation output modality
  - File-naming, file content structure

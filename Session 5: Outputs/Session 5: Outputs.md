# Outputs

In past sessions, we've performed parameter search explorations with our sample data. We visualized how one metric, FCDvariance, varies in our parameter space:

This session, we'll look at other metrics we may want to optimize for in our search for our optimal parameter combinations.

## Generating empirical metrics
We will need rerun simulations for our optimal parameter combinations so that we can save out some outputs (e.g. simulation timeseries) that would be too burdensome to save from all simulations in our parameter search exploration.

## Running our PSE with our new metrics
We will need rerun simulations for our optimal parameter combinations so that we can save out some outputs (e.g. simulation timeseries) that would be too burdensome to save from all simulations in our parameter search exploration.

## Picking our optimal parameter combinations
We will need rerun simulations for our optimal parameter combinations so that we can save out some outputs (e.g. simulation timeseries) that would be too burdensome to save from all simulations in our parameter search exploration.

## Rerunning our optimal parameter combinations
We will need rerun simulations for our optimal parameter combinations so that we can save out some outputs (e.g. simulation timeseries) that would be too burdensome to save from all simulations in our parameter search exploration.
